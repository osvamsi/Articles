    - A tax on the growth in value of investments, paid once they are sold. If an investment is owned for less than one year before it is sold, the seller pays a short-term capital gains tax.
    - If an investment is owned for longer than one year before it is sold, the seller pays a long-term capital gains tax, which is usally lower than typical income tax.

- Commodity
    - Commodities are any raw materials that can be bought and sold. Some examples include wheat, cotton, petroleum, silicon and gold. The price of commodities isn't typically correlated to stocks and bonds, meaning prices don't necessarily move in the same direction. Investing in commodities (or ETFs that own commodities) can be a way to furthur diversify your portfolio beyond traditional securities.

- Compounding
    - Compounding is a powerful process that accelerates the pace of your money's growth over time. If you earn a return on your investments, that return is added to your returns on both your principal and your past returns. Think of this like earning interest on interest, or the snowball effect.

- Day Trading 
    - An investing strategy involving buying and/or selling investments quickly, often mutiple times in a single day. By trying to time pruchases and sales with the peaks and valleys of the stock market, a daytrader might earn a profit-- or suffer losses. We believe this is a risky way to invest, and suggesr investing for the longterm instead.

- Diversification
    - It can be summed up by the common phrase: "Don't put all of your eggs in one basket." We recommend investing in a diverse mix of stocks, bonds and ETFs that aren't all subject to the same market factors --consider different industries, company sizes and geegraphies. This strategy can be an effective way to manage your portfolio's overall risk.


- Dividend
    - When a company makes a profit, it may pay out some of those earnings directly to its shareholders in the form of dividends. Dividends usally pay out on a quarterly or annual basis.
